Tawa Toolkit
------------

This tar distribution contains an implementation of the Text
Analysis from Wales & Waikato Toolkit ("Tawa") written by Bill Teahan
that was previosuly based on the Text Mining Toolkit ("TMT").


Directories:
-----------

The distribution should contain the following directories:
Tawa/
	This contains the source for the API (application programming interface).

config/
	This contains various files for building libraries etc. (CONFIG,
	INSTALL, README, etc.)

data/
	This contains various text files, such as the bible in various languages.
	These files are used in many of the demos. 

	The files data/misc/chinese.txt and data/demo/segment_Chinese.txt are
	short exerpts (100,000 words and 1,000 symbols, respectively) taken
	(with permission) from Guo Jin's (guojin@hotmail.com) PH_corpus of segmented
        Mandarin Chinese text kindly provided with permission from Chris Brew
        (Chris.Brew@edinburgh.ac.uk) and Julia Hockenmaier (julia@cogsci.ed.ac.uk).
	The full PH_corpus may be obtained from the site ftp.cogsci.ed.ac.uk.

demo/
	This contains the makefile for building the models for the demos.

doc/
	This contains documentation about Tawa, including Latex source and postscript
	for the DCC'99 paper and more recent NLE paper.

include/ and lib/
	These directories are used for compiling the sources.

models/
	This contains the models built for the demos.

apps/
	This contains a lot of sample demo applications and their source code which uses
	the Tawa Toolkit's libraries.

train/
	This contains the train program and its source for building ("training") a
	model, given some "training" text as input.


How do I install it?
--------------------

Look in the file INSTALL for instructions.

What does it do?
----------------

Lots. Look in the file samples/Doc.1 for a list of sample applications.
There is also quite a few demo programs which can be run. Just type "make demo"
in each of the sample sub-directories. 

Overview:
---------
A few people have asked about the API for statistical modelling I'm
currently writing. It's still in the development stages, but I can
give a short example to illustrate how it works.

There are three main types of objects:

    1) model
         A number associated with a statistical model e.g. one model might
         have been trained on French text, anotGher on English text etc.
    2) symbol
         A number associated with a symbol in the alphabet (the API
         treats the symbols as unsigned integers; it doesn't know anything
         about what the symbols stands for i.e. whether they are ASCII characters,
         letters in the English alphabet, hieroglyphics, or whatever).
    3) context
         A number associated with the prediction context; this context is
         is updated after each symbol has been processed, and is used to make
         a prediction for subsequent symbols.

In the toolkit's libraries, there are routines to load a static model (from a file
on disk), create dynamic models, create a context associated with a model, step
through the probability distribution for predicting the next symbol given the current
context etc.

Experiments I did for my Ph.D. thesis based on using PPM text
compression models showed that the language could be identified using
this approach with almost 100% accuracy (it was even able to detect
the difference between samples of American and British English text
with 100% accuracy by training two models on text contained in the
Brown and LOB corpora).
